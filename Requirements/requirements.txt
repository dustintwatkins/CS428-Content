Requirements
Most important features to be implemented first

1. Salesforce Data Synchronizer
    Leader:
      Justin B.

    Brief Description:
      We need access to a client company's sales data stored in Salesforce.
      We need to map their data to our database and be able to query from Salesforce and
      store the pertinent data in our database.

    User Story:
      A company will describe their sales pipeline and where they store that data
      and we can synchronize their information to our database so that we can query it
      from our database in a usable format.

2. Authentication
    Leader:
      Chris B.

3. Skill Recommendation Algorithm
    Leader:
      Dustin W.

    Brief Description:
      Algorithm that analyzes a linear sales pipeline for an individual sales
      representative's performance over the past 90 days and recommend a skill
      that sales representative should develop.

    User Story:
      A sales rep can view which skill he/she should train on
      A sales manager can view the individual's on his/her team and know what
      skill each individual should be trained on

  4. What if Calculator
      Leader:
        Dustin W.

      Brief Description:
        Whatever skill the `Skill Recommendation Algorithm` suggests, calculate
        the sales representative's new income IF they were to become proficient
        (meaning performing at company/industry standard) at that skill. Return
        the difference of their past 90 day revenue and potential income. This
        gives a dollar incentive to training and development of the recommended skill.

      User Story:
        A sales representative can view how much a training is worth if they
        become proficient at it.
