# Test Plan

### Methodology
We work in two-week increments targeting specific features. The feature is considered done once all other team members are unanimous that it's completed.
The following requirements are used to determine if a feature is done
* The feature is merged into master which requires a code review approval from at least one other team member
* The feature is demonstrable
* The feature is complete according to the spec
* All team members agree the feature has been adequately tested (more detail below)

### Key Values
* Validation and verification
* Enable leaders to lead by automating management 
* Empower leaders with data driven insights to allow them to develop their teams 

### Requirements and Guidelines
* Code styling
* StandardTS
Each feature has addressed known security vulnerabilities and has been reviewed by another team member 
* DOS
* Data injection attacks
* Cross site scripting
* Clickjacking
* Information exposure

### Metrics:
* Working towards implementing Objective Key Results 

### Reviews: 
* All code that is pushed to master are reviewed by a different developer

### Testing:
* Salesforce APEX code
* * 100% Line coverage
* * Automated output validation
* Server Code
* * Algorithm Tests
* * * 100% Line coverage on all public methods
* * * Output accuracy validation on all public methods
* * * Performance testing (stress and speed)


### Configuration Management
When master is updated, the server updates and redeploys automatically
Production, Staging and Development servers
	

### Defect/feature management
We use Asana to manage the product backlog, bug tracking and the current sprint tasks.The product backlog is ordered by feature priority. The feature priority is initially set by the product manager and verified by the shareholders and customers

### Process/deliverable improvement
At the conclusion of every sprint, the developers hold a retrospective meeting. The goal of the meeting is to identify positive and negative things that occurred in the previous sprint. We take this as an opportunity to reinforce and improve our team culture and development process.
